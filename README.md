# iOS-TimeTest

# DESCRIPTION


Five measures are included in TimeTest to assess how psychiatric patients perceive time. 
It was created for the psychiatric assistant's article to be published. Since it's a private app, I'm simply sharing the login screens.

## Technologies: Swift-UIKit, FireStore, Cocoapods
